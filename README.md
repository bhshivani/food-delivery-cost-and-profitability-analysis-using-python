# food-delivery-cost-and-profitability-analysis-using-python
This analysis provides a solid structure for evaluating and optimizing the cost and profitability of a food delivery business. It delves into each financial component of the operation, from revenue streams like commissions to cost factors such as discounts, payment fees, and delivery expenses. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key steps and findings, which can be helpful for anyone looking to understand or perform similar profitability analyses:

### 1. Data Preparation:
   - **Data Cleaning**: Handle dates, clean discount formats, and calculate derived columns such as `Discount Amount` and `Discount Percentage`.
   - **Feature Engineering**: Create columns to represent total costs and profit per order, enabling more targeted profitability insights.

### 2. Cost and Revenue Analysis:
   - **Total Cost Calculation**: Sum delivery fees, processing fees, and discounts to get a comprehensive view of costs.
   - **Revenue Calculation**: Calculate revenue as a function of commission fees, allowing for a comparison with costs.
   - **Profit Calculation**: Net profit per order is determined by subtracting total costs from revenue.

### 3. Results:
   - **Summary Metrics**: With 1,000 orders analyzed, the results revealed a net loss. High discount costs and relatively low commission fees have led to unprofitability.
   - **Visualization**: Histograms, pie charts, and bar charts provide clear visual insights, showing high costs driven by discounts and an overall negative profit trend.

### 4. Strategic Adjustments:
   - **Recommendation for Profitability**:
     - **Higher Commissions**: Profitable orders show that a commission rate closer to 30% could make orders more profitable.
     - **Lower Discounts**: Reducing discounts to around 6% could minimize losses without drastically reducing order volume.
   - **Simulation**: Using these recommended values, simulate potential profitability to assess the impact of changes on a broader scale.

### 5. Visualization of Recommended Changes:
   - **Comparison Plots**: By plotting estimated profitability based on recommended rates against actual profitability, a clearer understanding of potential improvement is obtained, especially if adjustments are adopted across the board.

This analysis underscores how optimizing commission and discount structures can create a more profitable business model. Simulating profitability adjustments is particularly valuable, as it helps to forecast the financial outcomes of proposed changes. This approach not only improves decision-making but also aligns operational strategies with financial goals, an essential practice for sustainable profitability in competitive markets.
